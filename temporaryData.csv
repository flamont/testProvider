In July 2019, Pool was invited to participate in a White House event hosting right-wing internet personalities who Trump characterized as unfairly targeted for their views

In August 2020, Trump liked a tweet published by Pool expressing sympathy and support for Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Illinois then facing trial on homicide charges of killing two people during the riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin, for which he was ultimately acquitted.[56] Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., retweeted a statement by Pool describing how the case of Rittenhouse had convinced Pool to vote for Trump.

A report from the Election Integrity Partnership (EIP) said that Pool was a ""superspreader"" of fake news surrounding voter fraud before and after the 2020 United States presidential election.[

In November 2022, Pool interviewed rapper and presidential candidate Kanye West on his podcast, Timcast IRL. West's political advisors, Milo Yiannopoulos and white supremacist Nick Fuentes also participated in the interview. The interview came days after West and Fuentes met with former President Trump

Michael,Knowles,"The Voices Young Conservatives Are Listening to Online - The New York Times

 American conservative political commentator, author, and media host. He has worked for The Daily Wire since 2016, and has hosted The Michael Knowles Show, a daily political podcast, since 2017.

Since joining The Daily Wire, Knowles has published two books: Reasons to Vote for Democrats in 2017 and Speechless: Controlling Words, Controlling Minds in 2021.

In April 2019, Knowles gave a speech at the University of Missouri–Kansas City titled ""Men Are Not Women"" during his YAF national college speaking tour. Student protesters disrupted his talk. One protester assaulted him and sprayed him with an unknown mixture, later determined to be lavender oil and other non-toxic household liquids.

In September 2019, Knowles called climate activist Greta Thunberg a ""mentally ill Swedish child"" on Fox News program The Story. 

In January 2020, while the first impeachment proceedings of President Donald Trump were underway, Knowles and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz launched the podcast Verdict with Ted Cruz.

At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in March, he further stated that ""there can be no middle way in dealing with transgenderism"", and ""if [transgenderism] is false, then for the good of society, and especially for the good of the poor people who have fallen prey to this confusion, transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely – the whole preposterous ideology

In 2017, Knowles released an empty book called Reasons to Vote for Democrats: A Comprehensive Guide.[42] The book, which contained 266 empty pages, became a bestseller on Amazon.",,,TRUE,2 100 000,1 300 000,2 490 000,861 400,,230 600,,,,,,Oui
Riley,Gaines,"The Voices Young Conservatives Are Listening to Online - The New York Times

is an American conservative political activist and former collegiate swimmer known for campaigning against the participation of trans women in women's sports. Since 2023, Gaines has hosted the weekly OutKick and Fox Nation podcast Gaines for Girls.

In July 2024, Gaines spoke at the Republican National Convention in support of Trump.[50]

In February 2025, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a new webpage showcasing new guidance on women's health featuring videos with Gaines talking about her role helping with Executive Order 14201, which threatens to revoke federal funding from any elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institution that allows transgender girls to play on girls' teams

An August 2025 profile in The New York Times made note that Gaines's activism often includes publicly targeting and insulting transgender individuals, including teenage athletes, on social media to her 1.5 million followers. It further explained that Gaines' position is that sports is a gateway to invalidating the wider womanhood of transgender women, with Gaines quoted as saying ""The gender ideology movement is a house of cards, and I believe it’s lying on that sports issue (...) This will be the card that makes all of it crumble.""",,Turning Point USA,TRUE,40 100,1 600 000,,1 100 000,9000,1 400 000,,Gaines has since spoken with Trump too many times to count,,,,Oui

Tatum runs a YouTube channel called ""The Officer Tatum""[9] with over 3 million subscribers. As of May 2023, he has accumulated over 571 million total views.[citation needed]

Tatum has also appeared as a guest on Candace Owens's PragerU show The Candace Owens Show as well as her The Daily Wire political podcast Candace as a panelist.

Along with Owens,[10] Tatum founded Blexit,[11][12] an organization meant to persuade the black American population to leave the Democratic Party and re-register as Republicans. The name Blexit is a portmanteau, a combination of the words ""black"" and ""exit"".",,"PragerU

In August 2020, Trump liked a tweet published by Pool expressing sympathy and support for Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Illinois then facing trial on homicide charges of killing two people during the riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin, for which he was ultimately acquitted.[56] Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., retweeted a statement by Pool describing how the case of Rittenhouse had convinced Pool to vote for Trump.

A report from the Election Integrity Partnership (EIP) said that Pool was a ""superspreader"" of fake news surrounding voter fraud before and after the 2020 United States presidential election.[

In November 2022, Pool interviewed rapper and presidential candidate Kanye West on his podcast, Timcast IRL. West's political advisors, Milo Yiannopoulos and white supremacist Nick Fuentes also participated in the interview. The interview came days after West and Fuentes met with former President Trump

an American right-wing political commentator and podcast host. He hosts the podcast The Matt Walsh Show, and regularly appears on the American conservative website The Daily Wire. Walsh has authored four books and starred in The Daily Wire documentary films What Is a Woman? and Am I Racist?

Walsh opposes transgender rights and has campaigned in opposition to groups providing or encouraging transgender health care, particularly for minors. In 2022, Walsh released Johnny the Walrus, a children's book in which he compared being transgender to pretending to be a walrus, and What Is a Woman?, a documentary film about gender identity in the United States. Walsh has campaigned against several hospitals, comparing the transgender healthcare they provide to child sexual abuse, genital mutilation, and rape.
